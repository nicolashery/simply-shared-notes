# Simply Shared Notes

**Simply Shared Notes** lets you create and share notes with others — no accounts, no passwords, no friction.
Create a **Space**, add one or more notes in plain text Markdown, and share the **Access Link** to give others instant access.

Each Space has one or more **Members**, allowing people to identify themselves and have their contributions tracked — all without needing to register. It’s built on trust, designed for small private groups.
